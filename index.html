				<h2>Read about me!</h2>
				<div class="drawer">
					<p>
						I'm a web developer in central PA specializing in hand-coded
						HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I work primarily with client-side
						optimization, making sure your site looks great in every browser
						and runs well on every device.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether you're building an Angular app or updating a ten year
						old CRM system, I can get you where you need to be. There's
						always a way to make things work, and I can help you find the 
						cleanest, most efficient way to do it.

					<p>
					A small JavaScript game similar to <i>Dope Wars</i> and other
					resource management games, but also includes a randomized encounter
					system, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure mechanic, and some
					experimental UI elements. It also features a pure CSS/JS
					starfield background that's lightweight and modular.
					</p>

					<p>
					<p>
					It was a refreshing change to develop this, and I learned
					(and re-learned) a lot about object/variable manipulation
					in the process, as well as organizational best practices.
					I update this from time to time but it will most likely
					live as a perpetual coding sandbox / work in progress.
					I keep some of the newest additions on an experimental branch
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.drewpeifer.com/experimental/spacetrade">
						hidden over here
					</a>
					because some features haven't been cross-browser tested or
					optimized for mobile use, but feel free to play around with it.
