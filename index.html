				<p>
					I'm a web developer in central PA specializing in hand-coded
					HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I work primarily with client-side
					optimization, making sure your site looks great in every browser
					and runs well on every device.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you're building an Angular app or updating a ten year
					old CRM system, I can get you where you need to be. There's
					always a way to make things work, and I can help you find the cleanest,
					most efficient way to do it.

					When I work on personal projects I like to be creative and have a bit of
					fun. Listed below are a few live demos, each with something behind-the-scenes
					that makes it a little interesting (at least to me) and unique.

					An HTML/CSS/jQuery animation of stars passing by, built to act
					as a lightweight background or sidebar animation. It's modular (easy to implement
					elsewhere), responsive (works at any resolution), cross-browser, and
					cross-device. Pretty serene, too.

				</p>
				<p>
					Another HTML/CSS/jQuery proof-of-concept for a rotating virtual business card.
					I used a combination of folding and rotating animations to create the card itself
					as well as the flipping anitmaitons.
					I owe a big thanks to the awesome JavaScript library
					<a target="_blank" href="http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/">transit.js</a>
					made my code much more concise and legible, while keeping the animations
					cross-browser compatible and mobile-friendly using a single method.

					I've always wanted to design a game, and the attraction of making
					a browser-based game was obvious enough given the code I'm familiar with. This
					project was a stab at making a template for browser-based
					point-and-click adventures that would allow
					anyone to make a game with little or no coding knowledge. Designers would ideally
					create a set of basic JSON and plain text files (possibly Markdown)
					that describe each scene, characters, items, etc. and then upload custom graphics
					in the form of PNG's and sprites. The game engine would then parse those files
					and create HTML on the fly as the player progressed through the scenes and
					interacted with their environment. The link above takes you to the debugging
					sandbox, but as work continues I will eventually open source the entire engine
					as its own framework.

						Halloween HTML/CSS Shapes

					<a target="_blank" class="github" href="http://github.com/Drewpeifer/demo/tree/master/halloween-shapes">&nbsp;</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Inspired by the guys over at
					 <a target="_blank" href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/">
					 	CSS-Tricks
					 </a>, I made some HTML/CSS-only shapes for the Fall season.
					 Just like everything useful, they're responsive
					 and cross-browser/cross-device (mostly, there are browser-specific
					 breakpoints). Anyway, just a little bit
					 of seasonal fun. I like to think of web design as a strange form of art,
					 and I guess these are the equivalent of my late night doodles.
