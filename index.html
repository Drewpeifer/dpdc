						I'm an <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/747ee852-08ee-4970-b92c-d8e70a35cf55" target="_blank">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>,
						and one of my specialties is data visualization. To create an interactive dashboard like the one in these screenshots, all you need is a data source and a free AWS account.

					<p>
						AWS provides many powerful tools that allow users to collect, transform, and visualize complex data.
						For this particular dashboard, I started by downloading a free data dump (CSV) of
						<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/codebreaker619/congress-on-social-media-201520" target="_blank">
							US Congressional Member Social Media Statistics from 2015 through 2020
						</a>.
					</p>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox">
						<img class="qs-cap" src="img/QSdash2.PNG" />
					</label>
					<p>
						The data and its values weren't in the ideal format(s) for the
						<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/" target="_blank">AWS Quicksight</a> visualization tools,
						so I chose to host the CSV on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a>. This allowed me to
						leverage <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/" target="_blank">AWS Glue</a> for ETL calculations, and the transformed data was then
						imported as a Quicksight dataset. For the analysis, I chose to highlight comparisons in count of posts, followers, shares, and reactions,
						and I think the resulting dashboard displays some interesting trends and patterns.

						Medialytics is a single page app that shows you information about the content
						on your Plex server by parsing the XML feed that it generates.

					<p>
						If you have a hard drive full of media, you can download <a href="http://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex Media Server</a>
						(for free) to organize, watch, and/or share your media with friends. It comes with great diagnostic tools
						that tell you all about your server, e.g. who's watching what media, or which media gets watched the most.
						Unfortunately, it doesn't give you much information <i>about your personal library of media</i>, such as "Which genre holds the most movies in your collection?". That's where
						<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Drewpeifer/medialytics">Medialytics</a> comes in.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of analyzing your server and its activity, Medialytics reports on your <i>media library</i> itself.
						There are some nifty charts that explore metrics like studio, genre, and decade, plus aggregate library counts / durations. The big button at the bottom lets you view your content in an easy-to-browse mobile-friendly format, something that is not so easily done on most Plex clients.

					</p>
					<p>
						This is a single page demo that includes multiple examples of data visualization
						frameworks, such as:
						<a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>,
						<a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>, and
						<a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a>.
					</p>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox">
						<img class="data-cap" src="img/screencap_data3.png" />
					</label>
					<p>
						I also have a write-up about what it's like to develop with each framework, and their strengths / weaknesses.
						Vue.js is not usually referenced as a data-visualization framework (and has recently
						become synonymous with Angular and React), but the lightweight cleint-side version of Vue
						makes binding static data to a dynamic UI fast and easy.

					</p>
					<p>This is a simple implementation of <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a>, a client-side JS-based 3D framework.</p>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox">
						<img src="img/screencap_vr-solar.png" />
					</label>
					<p>
						It's specifically designed to work easily with VR integration, or just simple 3D web applications. It provides a lot of simple
						constructors and behavior that is more commonly reserved for desktop software / engines (e.g. Unity), such as lightbox effects
						or spacial geometry.
					</p>
					<p>
						This demo creates a (scaled) representation of our solar system, <b>including Pluto</b>. I have comments in the code describing how and why I modified certain variables in order to create a realistic but also navigable scene. While it's definitely notable that the A-Frame code is so easily initialized (I had this up and running super fast), it's also worth noting that it's a very small amount of code that generates the entire scene (less than 200 lines of JS + JSON combined).

						A small JavaScript game similar to <i>Dope Wars</i> and other
						resource management games, but also includes a randomized encounter
						system, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure mechanic, and some
						experimental UI elements.

						It was recently updated to use the awesome
						<a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">
							Vue.js
						</a>
						for binding the frontend to the backend (which required a ground-up
						re-write) and I think the code benefited enormously
						from the addition.

						I'm a space nerd at heart, so this was an interesting project
						that I actually return to and use from time to time, just for fun.
						It also features a pure CSS/JS starfield background that's lightweight and
						modular (which was a fun little project in itself).
