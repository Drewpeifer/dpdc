				<p>
					I'm a web developer in central PA specializing in hand-coded
					HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I work primarily with client-side
					optimization, making sure your site looks great in every browser
					and runs well on every device.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you're building an SPA with Vue or updating a ten year
					old CRM system, I can get you where you need to be. There's
					always a way to make things work, and I can help you find the 
					cleanest, most efficient way to do it.

					<h3>SpaceTrade (Live Demo)</h3>
				</a>
				<a target="_blank" class="github-sm" href="http://github.com/Drewpeifer/demo/tree/master/spacetrade">&nbsp;</a>
				<p>
				A small JavaScript game similar to <i>Dope Wars</i> and other
				resource management games, but also includes a randomized encounter
				system, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure mechanic, and some
				experimental UI elements.
				</p>
				<p>
				It was recently updated to use the awesome
				<a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">
					Vue.js
				</a>
				for binding the frontend to the backend, which required a ground-up
				re-write (but I think the code benefited enormously
				from the addition).
				</p>
				<a class="demo" target="_blank" href="http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/spacetrade">

				</a>
				<p>
				It was a refreshing change to develop this, and I learned
				(and re-learned) a lot about object/variable manipulation
				in the process, as well as organizational best practices.
				I update this from time to time but it will most likely
				live as a perpetual coding sandbox / work in progress.

					<h3>APOD Engine (Live Demo)</h3>
				</a>
				<a target="_blank" class="github-sm" href="http://github.com/Drewpeifer/demo/tree/master/apod-engine">&nbsp;</a>
				<p>
				A single page application that allows you to search
				for the official NASA
				<a target="_blank" href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">
					Astronomy Picture of the Day
				</a>
				for any date.
				</p>
				<a class="demo" target="_blank" href="http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/apod-engine">
				    <img src="img/screencap_apod.png" />
				</a>
				<p>
				I'm a space nerd at heart, so this was an interesting project
				that I actually return to and use from time to time, just for fun.
				It also features a pure CSS/JS starfield background that's lightweight and modular (which was a fun little project in itself).

					<h3>The Bachelor Cookbook (Live Demo)</h3>
				</a>
				<a target="_blank" class="github-sm" href="http://github.com/Drewpeifer/demo/tree/master/bachelor-cookbook">&nbsp;</a>
				<p>
				A single page application that feeds (yep) off of the open-source
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.recipepuppy.com/">
					Recipe Puppy
				</a>
				API, which is admittedly not quite robust enough to use for a 
				production app but works fine for demo purposes.
				</p>
				<a class="demo" target="_blank" href="http://www.drewpeifer.com/demo/bachelor-cookbook">
				    <img src="img/screencap_cookbook.png" />
				</a>
				<p>
				What began as an experiment with minimalist API queries
				ended up as a recipe search engine for poor, lonely men.
				The idea is to search for recipes that only require the
				ingredients you have on hand, plus or minus an ingredient or two.
				Believe it or not, &quot;Water&quot; and &quot;Bread&quot;
				do return results.
